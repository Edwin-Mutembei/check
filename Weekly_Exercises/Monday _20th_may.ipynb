    " A one dollar coin was introduced in Canada in 1987. It is referred to as a loonie because one side of the coin has a loon (a type of bird) on it. The two dollar coin, referred to as a toonie, was introduced 9 years later. Itâ€™s name is derived from the combination of the number two and the name of the loonie."
